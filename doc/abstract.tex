  \sTeX is a collection of {\LaTeX} package that allow to markup documents semantically without leaving the document format, essentially turning {\LaTeX} into a document format for mathematical knowledge management (MKM).
  
  \sTeX augments {\LaTeX} with
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Semantic macros} that denote and distinguish between mathematical concepts, operators, etc. independent of their notational presentation,
  	\item A powerful \emph{module system} that allows for authoring and importing individual fragments containing document text and/or semantic macros, independent of -- and without hard coding -- directory paths relative to the current document, 
  	\item A mechanism for exporting \sTeX documents to (modular) XHTML, preserving all the semantic information for semantically informed knowledge management services.
  \end{itemize}
