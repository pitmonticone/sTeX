\begin{sfragment}{Package and Class Options}
  
    \begin{itemize}
      \item|debug=|\meta{prefixes}: (see Developer Manual)
      \item|lang=|\meta{languages}: The languages to load the \pkg{babel}
        package with.
      \item|mathhub=|\meta{path}: See (somewhere).
      \item|usedeps|:
        Content loaded from external mach archives is persisted
        in the file \cs{jobname}|.deps|, along with md5 checksums
        of the originating file and of your |stex.sty|.

        If the checksums have not changed
        (and the original files even exist), the content of the
        |.deps|-file is loaded, obviating the need to reprocess
        the original files, which is usually expensive.

        If the package option |usedeps| is used (or the environment
        variable |STEX_USEDEPS| is set to anything other than |false|),
        the md5-check is ignored, as is the case where the original
        files do not exist. This effectively makes the |.deps|-file
        a definite replacement for the external archive content,
        making the tex-file standalone.
      \item|checkterms|: If this option is set (or the environment variable
        |STEX_CHECKTERMS| is set to anything other than |false|), all
        types, definientia and notations are being typeset in a throwaway
        box when they are declared as a sanity check.

        It is recommended to set this option if you are primarily using
        \sTeX with |pdflatex| every time you add or change notations
        or typed/defined symbol declarations. Subsequently, this
        check can be safely turned off.
      \item|image|:
    %%^^A      \item |index=|\meta{name}: the \meta{csname} is indexed as if
    %%^^A        one had written \cs{cs}\Arg{name}.
    %%^^A      \item |no-index|: the \meta{csname} is not indexed.
    %%^^A      \item |module=|\meta{module}: the \meta{csname} is indexed in
    %%^^A        the list of commands from the \meta{module}; the \meta{module}
    %%^^A        can in particular be |TeX| for \enquote{\TeX{} and \LaTeXe{}}
    %%^^A        commands, or empty for commands which should be placed in the
    %%^^A        main index.  By default, the \meta{module} is deduced
    %%^^A        automatically from the command name.
    %%^^A      \item |replace| is a boolean key (\texttt{true} by default) which
    %%^^A        indicates whether to replace |@@| as \pkg{l3docstrip} does.
