    \begin{sfragment}[id=sec.minimal-setup]{Minimal Setup for the \sTeX Package}
        In the best of all worlds, there is no setup, as you already have a new version of
        {\TeX}Live on your system as a {\LaTeX} enthusiast. If not now is the time to
        install it; see \cite{TeXLive:on}. You can usually update {\TeX}Live via a package
        manager or the {\TeX}Live manager \textbf{tlmgr}.
        \sTeX requires a \TeX{} kernel newer than February 2022. 

        Alternatively, you can install \sTeX from CTAN, the Comprehensive {\TeX} Archive
        Network; see \cite{stexCTAN:on} for details. We
        assume you have the \sTeX package in at least version 3.2 (September 2022).

    \begin{sfragment}[id=sec.git-setup]{GIT-based Setup for the \sTeX Development Version}
        If you want use the latest and greatest \sTeX packages
        that have not even been released to CTAN, 
        then you can directly clone them from the \sTeX development
        repository \cite{sTeX:github:on} by the following command-line instructions: 
        \begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
        cd <stexdir>
        git clone https://github.com/slatex/sTeX.git
        \end{lstlisting}
        and keep it updated by pulling updates via \lstinline|git pull| in the cloned \sTeX
        directory.
        Make sure to either clone the \sTeX repository into a local texmf-tree or to update your \lstinline|TEXINPUTS| environment variable, e.g. by placing the following line in your \lstinline|.bashrc|:
        \begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
        export TEXINPUTS="$(TEXINPUTS):<sTeXDIR>//:"
        \end{lstlisting}
