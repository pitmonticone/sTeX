\begin{sfragment}{Definitions, Theorems, Examples, Paragraphs}
\begin{smodule}{Statements}
    As mentioned earlier, we can semantically mark-up
    \emph{statements} such as definitions, theorems, lemmata, examples, etc.

    The corresponding environments for that are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \stexcode"sdefinition" for definitions,
        \item \stexcode"sassertion" for assertions, i.e.
            propositions that are declared to be \emph{true},
            such as theorems, lemmata, axioms,
        \item \stexcode"sexample" for examples, and
        \item \stexcode"sparagraph" for other semantic paragraphs,
            such as comments, remarks, conjectures, etc.
    \end{itemize}

    The \emph{presentation} of these environments can be customized
    to use e.g. predefined |theorem|-environments, see \sref{sec.customhighlight}
    for details.

    All of these environments take optional arguments
    in the form of |key=value|-pairs. Common to all of them are
    the keys |id=| (for cross-referencing, see \sref{sec.references}),
    |type=| for customization (see \sref{sec.customhighlight})
    and additional information (e.g. definition principles,
    ``difficulty'' etc), |title=|, and |for=|.

    The |for=| key expects a comma-separated list of existing
    symbols, allowing for e.g. things like
    \symdef{addition}[args=a,prec=100]{#1}{##1 \comp+ ##2}
    \symdef{multiplication}[args=a,prec=50]{#1}{##1 \comp\cdot ##2}
    \stexexample{
\begin{sexample}[
    id=additionandmultiplication.ex,
    for={addition,multiplication},
    type={trivial,boring},
    title={An Example}
]
    $\addition{2,3}$ is $5$, $\multiplication{2,3}$ is $6$.
\end{sexample}
    }
