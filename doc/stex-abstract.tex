\begin{abstract}
  \sTeX is a collection of {\LaTeX} packages that allow to markup documents semantically
  without leaving the document format.

  Running `pdflatex` over sTeX-annotated documents formats them into normal-looking
  PDF. But sTeX also comes with a conversion pipeline into semantically annotated HTML5,
  which can host semantic added-value services that make the documents active
  (i.e. interactive and user-adaptive) and essentially turning {\LaTeX} into a document
  format for (mathematical) knowledge management (MKM).
  
  \sTeX augments {\LaTeX} with
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{semantic macros} that denote and distinguish between mathematical concepts,
    operators, etc. independent of their notational presentation,
  \item a powerful \emph{module system} that allows for authoring and importing individual
    fragments containing document text and/or semantic macros, independent of -- and
    without hard coding -- directory paths relative to the current document, and
  \item a mechanism for exporting \sTeX documents to (modular) XHTML, preserving all the
    semantic information for semantically informed knowledge management services.
  \end{itemize}
